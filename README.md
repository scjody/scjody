Professionally, I work as a software developer. I have a lot of experience with backend development, High Performance Computing (HPC), and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and a a not-so-secret past working on the Linux kernel (filesystems and FireWire).

I also build things for fun, including interactive digital art!
 * 🔥 [Fire Tetris](https://miaoulabs.com/) is my biggest and most impressive project. Its code, and some related projects that use the same Flamepixel panels, live in the [MIAOU Labs](https://github.com/miaoulabs) organization.
 * 📌 I've pinned a few smaller art projects below!
 * 🚇 [Node Computing](https://github.com/scjody/node) is my current art focus, intended to be exhibited at at event at [LESPACEMAKER](https://www.lespacemaker.com/en/) in fall 2024.
I don't do spoilers so don't ask me to explain what it is!

Here are a few open source projects from my time at [Plotly](https://plotly.com/):
* 🔐 [Security work on plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ascjody)
* 🐬 [Containerization and k8s support for Orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ascjody)
* 🔭 A bunch of enhancements to Dokku, especially [dokku-acl](https://github.com/dokku-community/dokku-acl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ascjody)
