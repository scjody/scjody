Professionally, I work as a software developer. I have a lot of experience with backend development, High Performance Computing (HPC), and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and a a not-so-secret past working on the Linux kernel (filesystems and FireWire).

I also build things for fun, including interactive digital art!
 * 🔥 [Fire Tetris](https://miaoulabs.com/) is my biggest and most impressive art project. Its code, and some related projects that use the same Flamepixel panels, live in the [MIAOU Labs](https://github.com/miaoulabs) organization.
 * The [Pink Pulsating Pancreas](https://github.com/scjody/pancreas?tab=readme-ov-file#pink-pulsating-pancreas) was a scale model of a human pancreas, designed to be entertaining and educational.
 * [Accueil](https://gitlab.com/scjody/accueil) is a loon-based game played by scanning physical artifacts, written for [a party we hosted](https://modernduck.com/2024/11/accueil/).
 * [Greetings](https://modernduck.com/2023/11/greetings/) was an art experience with [supporting software](https://github.com/scjody/greetings).
 * [Lumière Intense Générant Hallucinations Tigrées](https://github.com/scjody/light) was an Arduino-based DMX lighting controller designed to flash lights in strobe patterns to explore ganzfield spaces, imaginary colours, and other quirks of the human visual cortex!
 * [Dolphin](https://github.com/scjody/dolphin) was a Kinect-based installation with orcas! 🐬

Here are a few open source projects from my time at [Plotly](https://plotly.com/):
* 🔐 [Security work on plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ascjody)
* 🐬 [Containerization and k8s support for Orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ascjody)
* 🔭 A bunch of enhancements to Dokku, especially [dokku-acl](https://github.com/dokku-community/dokku-acl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ascjody)

Thanks for visiting! 💛🤍💜🖤
