Professionally, I work as a software developer. I have a lot of experience with backend, DevOps, and infrastructure type things, and a a not-so-secret past working on the Linux kernel (filesystems and FireWire).

I also build things for fun, including interactive digital art!
 * ðŸ”¥ [Fire Tetris](https://miaoulabs.com/) is my biggest and most impressive project. Its code, and some related projects that use the same Flamepixel panels, live in the [MIAOU Labs](https://github.com/miaoulabs) organization.
 * ðŸ“Œ I've pinned a few smaller art projects below!
